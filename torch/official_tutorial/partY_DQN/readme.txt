Largely based on the official pytorch tutorial on
https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html

Some difference to the above tutorial:
* Put the various components into modules to avoid a large script
* [TODO] better plot and visualization
* [TODO] stack more frames for better training performance
* [TODO] better terminal output

More to do:
* test if runnable on GPU
* test on multiple platform
* try to avoid using torchvision
* better coding (between modules)
